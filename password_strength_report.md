## 2. Tips Learned from the Evaluation

1. **Length Matters**: Longer passwords earn significantly higher scores.
2. **Mix of Characters**: Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to increase complexity.
3. **Avoid Repetitions**: Repeated characters (case-insensitive) reduce strength.
4. **Avoid Consecutive Patterns**: Consecutive uppercase/lowercase letters or numbers lower security.
5. **Middle Placement of Numbers/Symbols**: Placing numbers or symbols in the middle adds to strength.
6. **Meet All Requirements**: At least 8 characters and 3 of the 4 character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

## 3. Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack**: Systematically tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found. Long and complex passwords reduce feasibility.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a precompiled list of common passwords or dictionary words to guess passwords quickly. Avoid dictionary words or common substitutions.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked credentials from one site to gain access to other accounts. Prevent by using unique passwords for each site.
- **Phishing**: Trick users into revealing passwords through fake websites or emails. Awareness and verification of sources are crucial.

## 4. How Password Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity directly impacts the difficulty of guessing or cracking it:
- **Length** exponentially increases brute-force difficulty.
- **Character Variety** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) increases possible combinations.
- **Avoiding Predictable Patterns** makes dictionary and hybrid attacks less effective.
- **Randomness** ensures the password cannot be easily guessed from known data.

**Conclusion**: A strong password should be long, contain a mix of character types, avoid patterns and repetitions, and be unique for each account.
